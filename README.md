# Magician's Funny Money - Digital Recreation ðŸŽ©âœ¨

## The Story

My 8-year-old son attended a magic show by Mister Illusion and was absolutely thrilled when the magician gave him a special "funny money" dollar bill. He gave it to me (his dad) for safekeeping, and I tucked it into my pocket.

Unfortunately, the dollar got wet and tore. ðŸ˜¢

When we looked on the magician's website hoping to find a replacement, the funny money wasn't available. Instead of giving up, my son decided to take matters into his own hands!

## The Project

Using AI coding assistants (Claude Code and Cursor), my son embarked on a journey to recreate the torn brochure as a digital version using HTML and CSS. This repository contains his experiments with web-based recreation of the magician's funny money dollar.

With a bit of help from dad on the printing side, we successfully transformed his digital creation back into a physical funny money dollar! ðŸŽ‰

## What's Inside

- `magic-brochure-hifi.html` - The main HTML/CSS recreation of the funny money
- `images/` - Magic trick illustrations used in the brochure
- `original-brochure/` - Scans of the original torn brochure for reference
- `magician-brochure-hifi.pdf` - The printable version

## A Learning Adventure

This project represents:
- A child's introduction to coding with AI assistance
- Problem-solving through technology
- The magic of turning a disappointment into a creative opportunity
- Father-son collaboration on a meaningful keepsake

## The Real Magic âœ¨

The real magic wasn't just in the tricks on the dollar bill, but in watching an 8-year-old discover he could use technology to recreate something special that was lost. Every line of generated code was a step in his coding journey!
